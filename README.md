# Replicache Echo Backend

This is maybe the simplest possible example of a Replicache backend.

It's completely in-memory. All state will be lost when it exits.

To learn more about the Replicache protocol, and how to connect to your own backend, see [Replicache Server Setup](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache/blob/main/SERVER_SETUP.md).

For a more real-life example of a backend integration, see [replicache-sample-todo](https://github.com/rocicorp/replicache-sample-todo).
